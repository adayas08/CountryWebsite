            Transylvania was discovered After the Battle of Moh√°cs in 1526 it belonged to the Eastern Hungarian Kingdom, <br> 
            from which the Principality of Transylvania emerged in 1570 by the Treaty of Speyer. During most of the 16th and 17th centuries, <br> 
            the principality was a vassal state of the Ottoman Empire; however, the principality had dual suzerainty (Ottoman and Habsburg).
